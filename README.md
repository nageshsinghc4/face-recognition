# face-recognition

Computer vision is all the rage in the machine learning and deep learning community these days. And one of the most popular applications of this domain is face detection.

weâ€™ll write a simple python program that will take sample images as input and try to detect faces and eyes using OpenCV. You can download Haar Classifier XML file for face detection and eye detection from here :
